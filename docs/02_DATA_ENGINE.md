# 02 Data Engine

The clean target workflow does not fetch provider payloads during validation. It
uses deterministic, sanitized contracts to preserve the active Class A behavior
needed through GOAL-06B.

## Active Contracts

- Approved-symbol-only universe boundary.
- Source health contract with source-origin labels.
- Trading-day calendar contract.
- Market, sector, stock, event, and review-only NLP contract layers.
- PIT signal snapshot with decision cutoff timestamps.
- Label snapshot generated after target-day close.
- Feature-label merge with explicit excluded-column manifest.
- Leakage audit that prevents labels from entering scoring features.

## Source Evidence Warnings

- CNINFO did not cover `002475.SZ` in inspected source evidence.
- Tencent returned no usable rows under bounded variants.
- These warnings are documented and do not block deterministic GOAL-06B
  reproduction in the clean repo.

## Safety Rules

- Do not fetch or commit raw provider payloads.
- Do not use ingestion time as publish time.
- Do not convert post-target labels into premarket features.
- Do not treat provider availability as symbol approval.
- Do not unlock recommendation, risk, dashboard, paper/live trading, production
  writes, model promotion, or DQN/RL.
